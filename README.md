# Number Guessing Game

Welcome! 

In this repository you'll find a school project I did a while ago. It is a *number guessing game*. 
The game is done in Android Studio using Java as the main programming language. 

### Objective 
The number guessing game is based on a concept were the player guesses a number in a given range. Since the game is provided with 
limited attempts, player has to guess the number within those limited attempts, else they will loose. In this game, after the user
inputs a number they can get a hint whether the guess is too low or too high, just as in cold or hot. Number guessing game is an 
exciting game that hooks a player to know which is the secret number. 

Through this game, there will be a set of conditions that will give a better expierence to the user.
